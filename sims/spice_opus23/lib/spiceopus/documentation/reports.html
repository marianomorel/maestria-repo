					Overview

					<div class="content-txtbox-noshade"><p>
          So after all the fun and excitement with development or research it's time to present results 
          to the public. And for many including us this is usually starting point for mostly boring and sometimes 
          frustrating work. Pictures never seem to be in the right format, they have poor resolution, fonts 
          are ugly or word processor simply crashes when importing them, etc... So here are two examples 
          which show you how we have solved this problems.</P>
          <P>In the first example you can see a picture in PNG format which was automatically generated from 
          Spice Opus plot window. We set things in such a way that you get a picture of the same size which 
          is configurable through the init file.
          <img src="./img/splot.png" class="img-left-noborder-topmargin" width="" height="" alt="" />
          <p class="table-caption">Example of automatically generated picture in PNG format from Spice Opus Plot Window</P>
          <P>Second example is in PDF format so you need Adobe Acrobat Reader or Ghostscript to see 
          <A  HREF="http://www.spiceopus.si/download/splot.pdf">Example of Spice Opus Plot Window in PDF format</A>. In this case picture was 
          automatically generated in PDF format and included in MIKTEX document. You can find more about 
          MIKTEX on <A HREF="http://www.miktex.org/">MIKTEX home page</A>.</P>
          <P>If you like the results proceed to the following sections where you will find all necessary information 
          how to do it yourself on your platform without much hassle. Since the actual conversion is done by Ghostscript 
          it is also possible to generate pictures in other graphic formats suitable for inclusion in almost any 
          word processor (MS Word, Wordperfect...). Also this approach is not limited to the Spice Opus, but you 
          can use it with any other program.</P>

					Generating Pictures of Plot Window
          </p>                            
					<div class="content-txtbox-noshade"><p>
          Procedure to generate pictures is quite the same on Windows and Linux so the following explanation covers both 
          operating systems. Details about about required software, installation, configuration, troubleshooting and other 
          platform dependent specifics are explained in the dedicated sections. For those who want to change or to improve 
          something there are additional information in <A HREF="#ss3">Soexp Utility</A>.</P>
          <P>Procedure to generate picture of plot window goes like this:</P>
          <OL class="noindent">
          <LI>Set the desired conversion options by editing soexp_ini. You will find all necessary information about 
          options and syntax well documented in the file itself. Because init file is always called from command line 
          you can have many different versions of it for specific tasks.
          <LI>Print the Spice Opus Plot Window in file. Here you can choose dimensions of picture and printing of Title and Time Stamp.
          <LI>Run the Soexp. To alter some options set in init file on per case basis you can specify them on the command line.
          This way many but not all conversion options can be changed.
          </OL>
          <P>If everything has gone well you now have the picture in desired format. On Windows platform it is possible to 
          merge step 2 and 3 and automate this procedure further (Linux to follow). In this case all settings on per case 
          basis could be done only through the init file.</P>
          
          <p class="content-title-noshade-size2">Linux Specifics
          <ul class="noindent">
          <li>The first program you need is the Soexp which is supplied with the Spice Opus or you can download latest 
          version from <A HREF="http://www.spiceopus.si/download/soexp.tar.gz">here</A>.
          <LI>The Ghostscript (GS) - should be at least version 6.0 or newer!!! - is the 
          only required program besides the Soexp. In year 2005 every GNU/Linux distribution includes at least version 7 
          of GS, so there is no need for separate download from <A HREF="http://www.ghostscript.com/">GS home page</A>. 
          Simply install GS with your preferred package management tool and that's all.
          <LI>To use GS as postscript and pdf viewer it is nice to have some kind of front end to it. On Linux there are 
          plenty of such front ends: GV, Ghostview, KGhostview,etc.. They are standard part of all distributions and you 
          can bet that at least one of them is already present on your system. 
          <LI>For viewing pdf documents on Linux platform my choice is xpdf. But it is always good practice to test 
          final result with a program used by majority of people. So you can get free (as beer) 
          <A HREF="http://ardownload.adobe.com/pub/adobe/reader/unix/7x/7.0/enu/AdbeRdr70_linux_enu.tar.gz">Acrobat Reader</A> 
          from Adobe.
          </UL>
          <P>Since we at our place use only Debian GNU/Linux (Sid and Sarge) and derivatives (MEPIS) all installation 
          specifics are dedicated to this distribution. At time of this writing Debian distributes tree different versions 
          of gs: gs-gpl, gs-afpl, gs-esp and all of them works with soexp.</P>
          <UL class="noindent">
          <LI>Install the Soexp:
          <p class="showcode">
          prompt:$ cd /usr/local/src<BR>
          prompt:$ tar -xvzf soexp.tar.gz<BR>
          prompt:$ gcc -Wall -o soexp soexp.c (only if you want to compile soexp by yourself!)<BR>
          prompt:# mv soexp /usr/local/bin</B> (as root!!)</P>
          <LI>As a root install one or more versions of the GS (omit unnecessary):
          <p class="showcode">prompt:# apt-get install gs-gpl gs-afpl gs-esp<br>
          <LI>And if you install more than one version of GS choose one to use through Debian system 
          of alternatives:
          <p class="showcode">prompt:# update-alternatives --config gs(as root!!)</P>
          </UL>
          <P>And that's all. If everything went smoothly you should have working system. You can verify it by 
          running ghostscript (gs) or any of mentioned front ends to it.</P>

          <p class="content-title-noshade-size2">Windows Specifics
          <P>At the beginning of this section I must inform you, that on the Windows platform we use only Windows 
          98/XP and all tests we performed were on this two versions of the Windows. There is no reason why the 
          whole procedure shouldn't work on other versions of Windows too, but we didn't test this.</P>
          <UL class="noindent">
          <LI>The first program you need is the Soexp which is supplied with the Spice Opus or you can download latest 
          version from <A HREF="http://www.spiceopus.si/download/soexp.zip">here</A>.
          <LI>Ghostscript - should be version 6.0 or newer!!! - is the only obligatory program besides the Soexp. 
          You can get it from <A HREF="http://www.ghostscript.com/">GS home page</A>. From the same site you can also 
          get the next two very useful utilities.
          <LI>The first one is Redmon which redirects printer output to other programs (in our case to the Soexp) 
          and thus makes possible to generate picture as simply as printing it to the printer. Because Redmon comes 
          as zipped archive you also need WinZip or similar utility to install it.
          <LI>The second one is GSview. It is a front end to Ghostscript and greatly simplify its use. This one is 
          not obligatory but it's handy if something goes wrong or you have decided to extend functionality of the 
          Soexp. In both cases please send us your results back so we could share them with other users.
          </UL>
          <P>Install the Soexp, just extract contents of archive into desired folder.</P>
          <P>The next program to install is Ghostscript. If you have decided to install GSview do it after 
          Ghostscript. Installation of both is very easy and straightforward process. Both come in single 
          executable file. Just run them and leave all options on their default values.</P>
          <P>If it is good enough for you that every time you want to generate a picture you have to 
          execute Soexp from the command prompt within the DOS window you can safely skip this step and 
          proceed with the installation of printer driver. Otherwise create folder c:\redmon and extract 
          content of Redmon archive into it. We will also use program Redrun which is part of Redmon. 
          If you are using Windows NT you should read readme.txt which comes with Redmon. Now you just 
          run setup.exe and you are done with installation. If you have decided not to install Redmon into 
          c:\redmon just be careful to use your own installation path instead of this one later.</P>
          <P>The last step is to install and configure Postscript printer driver. Any Postscript printer 
          driver should work as long it's set properly. We use driver for Apple LaserWriter II NT, the one 
          suggested in GSview documentation. According to this documentation it is preferred one because 
          it supports only basic postscript functions, so there shouldn't be any problems with compatibility. 
          All tests we did were done with this printer driver. If you have decided to use any other 
          printer and something doesn't work as expected, first try to use this one. 
          Because right printer settings are crucial for the success of operation here are those 
          which should be changed from their default values: 
          <p><B>Fonts</B> tab<BR> Always use <U>b</U>uilt-in printer fonts instead of TrueType fonts
          <p><B>PostScript</B> tab<BR> Postscript <U>o</U>utput format: Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)<BR>
          Postscript <U>h</U>eader: Assume header is downloaded and <U>r</U>etained</P>
          <P>If you have chosen not to use Redmon installation is finished
          otherwise proceed with Redmon configuration.</P>
          <OL class="noindent">
          <LI>Details tab - Add Por<U>t</U>
          <LI>Add Port - Other - Redirected Port
          <LI>Add Redirected Port - OK
          <LI>Details tab - Spoo<U>l</U> Settings...
          <LI>Spoo<U>l</U> Settings - Disable bi-directional support for this printer.
          <LI>Details tab - P<U>o</U>rt Settings...
          <LI>Because there are many settings here is a picture of them:
          </OL><br>
          <p><img src="./img/setrmon7.png" width="" height="" alt=""><
          <p>Short description of the first two settings may be valuable if you decide to change something. Program 
          redrun.exe which appears in "Redirect this port to the program:" is a part of Redmon. Its function is to 
          save printer output into the file with a random name and runs program in "Arguments for this program are:". 
          In our case this is the Soexp and all its command line. If the path to the Soexp is not set in a PATH variable 
          (autoexec.bat) should be included here. "%1" is the name of Soexp input file. If you have not specified ž
          output file on soexp command line under the Port Settings you will get output file with random name 
          in c:\windows\temp directory.
          <p>If you need to generate pictures in different formats frequently the best way is to set up more then 
          one printer and redirected port. You just repeat steps above and specify different printer name and command 
          line options for the Soexp (for example: --outtype=png).
